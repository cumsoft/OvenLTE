> Cumsoft OvenLTE is a simple interface that reads realtime cpu core tempature feedabck via Celsius tempature readout and helpful color coding. 
> The OvenLTE is the perfect tool for CPU overclocking. 
>
> This Release comes with two Apps:
> "Cumsoft_OvenLTE_App" & "Cumsoft_OvenLTE_Dev"
>
> The "Cumsoft_OvenLTE_App" has been preconfigured to estimate thresholds of the baseline CPU temp. More importantly it relays this information via color schemes which gives quick feedback on core system cpu temp changes. It is visible on the desktop and can be even read from afar.
>
> The "Cumsoft_OvenLTE_Dev" does not have preconfigured thresholds and allows the user to set them via minimum and maximum user input. Its function is still the same as the "App", However its legiblity is constrainted thus is better for users who are infront of console.
>
> Lastly it is important to note that the Cumsoft OvenLTE will run on debian with no additional packages needed. This software can run on other distros of linux but may require additional tooling and configuration. The Cumsoft OvenLTE framework is built off python and its legacy system assets. This means that you can launch the Cumsoft OvenLTE locally via Linux or have it run from the python/python3 folder.

> Cumsoft OvenLTE is a CPU Monitor, A CPU monitor is a software tool that tracks the usage or more specifically the tempature of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. It is important to track the temperature of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) because high temperatures can cause a variety of problems, including reduced performance and even permanent damage to the hardware. When a CPU operates at high temperatures for an extended period of time, it can cause the device to become unstable and potentially lead to hardware failures or system crashes. Additionally, high temperatures can cause the CPU to become less efficient, which can result in slower performance.
> 
> By monitoring the temperature of a CPU, you can ensure that it is operating within safe temperature limits and take action if necessary to prevent overheating. This can help to maintain the performance and lifespan of your device. Some common methods for tracking CPU temperature include using software tools or monitoring the temperature through the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) settings on the device.
>
> There are several ways that a CPU temperature monitor can be utilized:
>
> 1. To ensure that the CPU is operating within safe temperature limits: By monitoring the temperature of the CPU, you can ensure that it is not overheating and that it is operating within the safe temperature range recommended by the manufacturer. If the temperature rises above a certain level, you can take steps to reduce the load on the CPU or improve cooling to bring the temperature down.
>
> 2. To detect and diagnose problems with the cooling system: If the temperature of the CPU is consistently high, it could be a sign that there is a problem with the cooling system. A temperature monitor can help you to identify such issues and take corrective action, such as cleaning the fans or replacing a faulty cooler.
>
> 3. To optimize performance: By monitoring the temperature of the CPU, you can identify situations where the temperature is causing the CPU to throttle its performance in order to prevent overheating. By addressing the underlying cause of the high temperature, you may be able to improve performance.
>
> 4. To monitor the effectiveness of cooling modifications: If you have made modifications to the cooling system of your device, a temperature monitor can help you to determine whether these modifications are effective in reducing the temperature of the CPU.
>
> 5. To monitor the temperature of a server or other critical system: In a server or other mission-critical system, it is important to ensure that the temperature of the CPU is within safe limits to prevent downtime or hardware failures. A temperature monitor can help you to monitor the temperature of the CPU in real-time and take action if necessary.
